# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

This project delivers a **data-driven evaluation of vendor performance** to improve inventory management, pricing strategies, and vendor relationships in a **retail/wholesale business context**. By integrating purchase, sales, and vendor cost data, the analysis uncovers hidden profitability patterns, operational risks, and actionable optimization opportunities.

The solution is built using **Python, SQL, and SQLite**, and culminates in a **BI-style analytical dashboard** and recommendation framework designed to support strategic decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis was designed to answer the following critical business questions:

* Identify **underperforming brands** suitable for promotion or pricing changes
* Determine **top vendors** based on sales and purchase contribution
* Measure the **impact of bulk purchasing** on unit costs
* Evaluate **inventory turnover** to reduce holding costs
* Compare **profitability** between high- and low-performing vendors

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The project uses structured transactional and inventory data stored in CSV format:

* **purchases.csv** – Transaction-level purchase records
* **purchase_prices.csv** – Product pricing and unit cost details
* **vendor_invoice.csv** – Vendor billing, freight, and additional costs
* **sales.csv** – Sales transaction data
* **begin_inventory.csv / end_inventory.csv** – Inventory snapshots *(excluded from analysis)*

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion

* Loaded all CSV files into an **SQLite database (`inventory.db`)**
* Automated ingestion using `load_raw_data.py`
* Created normalized tables named after source files

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Explored schema, keys, and relationships using SQL
* Removed irrelevant inventory snapshot tables

### 3️⃣ Data Aggregation

* Created a consolidated table: **`vendor_sales_summary`**
* Joined purchases, prices, invoices, and sales data
* Derived KPIs:

  * Total purchase & sales quantity
  * Gross profit & profit margin
  * Inventory turnover
  * Sales-to-purchase ratio

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Converted volume fields to numeric
* Handled missing values
* Trimmed categorical columns
* Added calculated metrics (e.g., GrossProfit)

### 5️⃣ Analytical Insights

* Brand-level margin vs sales analysis
* Vendor dependency assessment
* Bulk purchasing cost evaluation
* Inventory turnover and slow-moving stock analysis
* Vendor profitability comparison

### 6️⃣ Statistical Validation

* Conducted **t-tests** to validate profit margin differences

## 📈 Key Findings

### 🔹 Underperforming Brands

* **198 brands** identified with *low sales but high profit margins*
* Example: *Santa Rita Organic Svgn Bl* – **66.47% margin** with minimal sales

### 🔹 Vendor Dependency Risk

* **Top 10 vendors account for 65.69% of purchases**
* Diageo North America alone contributes **16.30%**

### 🔹 Bulk Purchasing Advantage

* Unit costs dropped by **~72%** for large orders
* Small orders: **$39.06/unit** → Large orders: **$10.78/unit**

### 🔹 Inventory Turnover Issues

* **$2.71M worth of unsold inventory** detected
* Diageo alone holds **$722.21K** in slow-moving stock

### 🔹 Profitability Patterns

* Low-performing vendors show **higher margins (41.55%)**
* Top vendors average **31.17% margins**, indicating scale vs margin trade-offs
